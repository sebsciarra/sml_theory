# smltheory

Demonstrates propositions of supervised machine learning theories.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install smltheory
```

## Usage

`smltheory` can be used to demonstrate propositions of
supervised machine learning theories. Specifically, the functions
demonstrate the propositions of excess risk decomposition
and the bias-variance tradeoff. 

For a demonstration of each supervised machine learning proposition, see 
[whitepaper](https://sebastiansciarra.com/technical_content/understanding_ML).
